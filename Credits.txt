I supported this project by giving advice on how to structure the code, | I made the game and coded it with the help of Marlon Pasqual Marrero Arancibia, he helped me structure

classes. Besides this, I also took it upon myself to fix smaller issues | istelf. I was inspired by Final Fantasy 7, things I particularly enjoy about the game is it's attack 
in the code, for example, when re-structuring files, I would delete the | system, and the games story. Part of the reason I also decided to make Winter Town as a way to better my 
old files and rename the Scanners and Methods so that there would not be| knowledge of Java and working with more than one person in the programing feild. Marlon was a big help 
any conflicts. Besides this, I was usually on a call with a screenshare | and taught me not only how to code, but also what the code does. Over all this was a learning exprerience
