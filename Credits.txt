I supported this project by giving advice on how to structure the code, |
spoecifically, the names of the methods and the organization of the     |
classes. Besides this, I also took it upon myself to fix smaller issues |
in the code, for example, when re-structuring files, I would delete the |
old files and rename the Scanners and Methods so that there would not be|
 any conflicts. Besides this, I was usually on a call with a screenshare|
running so that I could guide Razr on how to code this small game. I    |
feel that it would be improper for me to call myself the project        |
manager, but I did have  a role which would fullful a similar function. |
He worked on it in his free time and I would manager the code structure |
and files. - Marlon Pascual Marrero Arancibia                           |
