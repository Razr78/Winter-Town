# Winter-Town
Winter Town is my first game that I coded on my own, with the assistance of Marlon Pascual Marrero Arancibia. I coded everything, unless stated otherwise but Marlon taught me most of the methods and algorithms used.

Winter Town is an RPG that takes place in a small rural town miles out of the big city. Our main charachter, (who you play as), has just moved into the town and is looking to start fresh and away from the loud and obnoxious city. However, terror struck with the murders of one of his neighbors. The thought had never crossed the minds of anyone living there. Now the question is, who is the killer among us....
